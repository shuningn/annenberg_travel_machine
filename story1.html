            When asked what the most memorable trip was, Julia shared a family trip in Greece with us.
            It was her first time that she got to choose somewhere she wanted to go. She was
            really into Greek mythology since the mythology class she took in her sixth grade.
            When she was 13, her family and she went on Greece together, where they visited 
            Athens and Delfi.  "It was almost just like affirming what I had seen or like 
            and read about. It was, you know,  just like everything I had pictured, like actually
            seeing it in real life", Julia said so when we asked what made her trip unique.
            Among all the places of interest, Julia recommended delfi, a really mythological cite,
            to us. It keeps up a lot of mythology culture and is surrounded by rich folklore
            and history.
