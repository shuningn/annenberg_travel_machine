                <h2>GREECE</h2>
                <p> Julia said her most memorable trip was a family trip to Greece. It was the first time that she got to choose somewhere she wanted to go. She had been interested in Greek mythology ever since studying about it in a mythology class when she was in sixth grade. When she was 13, she visited Athens and Delfi with her family. </p>

                <p> "It was almost just like affirming what I had seen or read about,” she said. “It was, just like everything I had pictured, like actually seeing it in real life." </p>

                <p> Among all the places of interest, Julia recommended Delfi, a really mythological site. As an ancient sanctuary located in upper central Greece, it keeps up a lot of mythology culture and is surrounded by rich folklore and history. </p>
