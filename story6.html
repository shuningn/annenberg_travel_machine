                    <h2>HAWAII</h2>
                    <p> Camille is a freshman at USC and has only been in Los Angeles for a few months. </p>

                    <p> In the summer, she went on a trip with her family to Hawaii. They went to Wahoo, the place where the movie “Jurassic Park” was filmed. </p>

                    <p>"It was like a good family bonding and for them to appreciate nature and how pretty our world is," Camille said.</p>

                    <p> Camille recommended a place called International Market Place in Honolulu which consists of an oceanside plaza with a mixture of shops and restaurants. </p>

                        <p>The state of Hawaii consists of eight  islands located in the Pacific Ocean. In 1959, it became the 50th state of the United States.The city of Honolulu is the capital of Hawaii and it is located on the island of Oahu.</p>
    
                        <p>Hawaii has a warm tropical weather and most of the time it only experiences two seasons. The highest temperature is in the 80s, but the weather will still vary from island to island. Since the islands were formed by volcanic activity, volcanoes are really common. It is a popular place to vacation with friends and family to experience the local customs.</p>
