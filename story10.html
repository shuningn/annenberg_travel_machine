                            <p>was her most memorable one yet.</p>

                        <p> Destiny went to Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano, with her friends. </p>

                        <p> “It’s a sacred space to the native Hawaiian people,” Destiny said. “It’s also a big place for astrology, so you can see all the stars. It was really nice. I’ve never seen the sky look like that because in Los Angeles you can’t really see as many stars.” </p>

                        <p> However, this place is also full of controversy “because they want to build another telescope up there. And so it’s problematic for the native people because that place means so much to them.” </p>

                        <p> It was a bittersweet moment when she learned this place was surrounded by so much beauty and controversy, she said.  She was impressed by the beautiful sky, but she also empathized with the  native people. </p>

                        <p>Hawaii has a warm tropical weather and most of the time it only experiences two seasons. The highest temperature is in the 80s, but the weather will still vary from island to island. Since the islands were formed by volcanic activity, volcanoes are really common. It is a popular place to vacation with friends and family to experience the local customs.</p>
