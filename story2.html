                    <h2>VIETNAM</h2>
                    <p> Cindy went to Vietnam with her friends and took a motorcycle ride with local people to different places in Saigon. They went to several spots for eating, drinking and experiencing the culture. </p>

                    <p> “We went to this street food place and they sold crabs and you just [sit] on the floor, but the tables were really low and it was like outdoors stuff. So that was really cool,” she said. </p>

                    <p> Cindy also visited the Vietnam War museum and said it was “impactful and moving.”  Her parents were born in Vietnam. This trip really hit home because her parents had some struggling experiences during the Vietnam War, she said. </p>

                        <h2>VIETNAM</h2>
                        <p> Vietnam is located in Southeast Asia. The capital city is Hanoi, which is located in the north, but Ho Chi Minh City is the most populous city. Vietnamese culture is influenced by French colonial rule and Chinese culture. So it is a combination of the Western and Eastern cultures. </p>

                        <p> Vietnam has an extremely long coastline and it also is a desirable place for diving. Vietnam has a tropical wet climate with heavy rains and occasional typhoons during summer. In general, it is a great place to avoid hot weather. </p>
