                            <p>Suppiger visited Lake Tahoe for a week in the summer. </p>
                            <p>“We stayed at my friend’s house. It was very fun,” he said. “We went on a boat and rode around. We also played spikeball on the beach.”</p>
                            <p>Suppiger recounted looking out into the lake one night. “It was dark out, but I could still see the reflection of the moon,” he said. “I was like, wow, this is where I'd love to live, sometimes have a home.”</p>
                            <p>“We would just stay up late and wake up in the next morning and have to clean up the house. Cans and water bottles were everywhere. Because we didn't have our parents there, we had to do a lot of work like washing all the dishes. Although it’s exhausting, it was still fun.”</p>
