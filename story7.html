                    <h2>London, England</h2>
                    <p>Alexa went on a trip to England and France, where she spent seven days with her family.</p>
                    <p>“I guess my most memorable trip was probably going to England and France. It was during spring break,” she said. “We spent six days in London and then one day in Paris. It's a lot of fun."</p>
                    <p> “Right next to Buckingham palace, there’s this ginormous park and we walked through it. There was this huge cherry blossom tree and my family and I sat underneath it. It was just a really good memory. My little sister and I were playing, so I was enjoying the moment with her.”
                    </p>
                    <p>“Even though like London, you don't think of it like it's a very big cultural hub. There's so many different people from all different parts of the world. It's kind of like the New York of that area."</p>
                    <p> “It kind of feels like a softer version of the United States. It seemed a lot more understanding. People were just generally a little bit kinder on the streets. Also, there was just more of an atmosphere of tolerance. I felt it was an interesting experience just to compare the two places.”
