                <h2>PARIS</h2>
                <p>Akmalov, an exchange student from Latvia, got caught in the rain 
                    while waiting in line for the Musée du Louvre. “When I went [to 
                    Paris], it was autumn,” he said. “I [saw] the rain in warm weather 
                    and it was really nice going in the city and seeing beautiful places." 
                    Akmalov said an unforgettable thing was his Nike shoes getting soaked 
                    by the rain. “Maybe it's not a pleasant memory, but it was fun,” he 
                    said.
