                    <h2>VIETNAM</h2>
                   <p> Lindsey has been to Vietnam seven times and each time was different from the last. She once went on a trip with U.S. military veterans. The group was going to meet with Vietnamese veterans.</p>

                    <p> “During war, they were enemies, but now they’re friends,” she said. She added that Vietnamese people are very open, welcoming and friendly. </p>

                    <p> Her most memorable experience was when she met up with a group of local college students in a coffee shop. </p>

                    <p> “They asked me if I would be willing to give an English lesson and since I’m a professor it seemed like a natural thing to do to have the teaching experience with local individuals,” she said. “So it was a win-win opportunity because I was able to use my skills and teaching and give them an impromptu English lesson and then they were able to show me photos of local cuisine and show me some pictures of the local heritage sites that I should visit.” </p>

                        <h2>VIETNAM</h2>
                        <p> Vietnam is located in Southeast Asia. The capital city is Hanoi, which is located in the north. According to The New York Times, Ho Chi Minh City is Vietnam's largest metropolis with “boundary-pushing nightlife.” Vietnamese culture draws its influence from various other cultures that were a part of its history, most notably French and Chinese. </p>

                        <p> Vietnam has an extremely long coastline and is also a popular destination for divers. Vietnam has a tropical wet climate and gets heavy rains and occasional typhoons during the summer. In general, it is a great place to get away from hot weather. </p>
