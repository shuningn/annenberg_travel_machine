                        <h2>ANGELS LANDING</h2>
                        <p> Gus  went on a road trip through the Southwest of the country with a couple of buddies during last year’s Thanksgiving holiday. They rented a car and drove through those amazing national parks, he said. They spent a day or two at Bryce Canyon National Park and Zion National Park in the Grand Canyon. Everyday, they drove through the night and just woke up before sunrise and then caught the sunset in and out of another park. </p>
 
                        <p> “The view at the top is just amazing,” he said. There are some parts on the side of a cliff to hold onto chains. If people slip, then they are done. </p>

                        <p> "There's a sign at the chart that says, ‘Hey, you know, someone has died every other year on this trail for the past 14 years. So be careful.’ Um, so that was really cool," Gus said. </p>

                            <h2>ANGELS LANDING</h2>
                            <p>Angels Landing is one of the world's most renowned hikes that’s worthy of all bucket lists. The unforgettable short adventure hike has views of Zion Canyon's 270 million-year-old rock layers that will take  you back to the Triassic period when this section of the Colorado Plateau was a flat basin at sea level. Anyone in average physical condition can make this heavenward trek, but it can be mentally challenging with its steep switchbacks and sheer drop-offs. There are chains bolted into the cliff to provide secure handholds. People who have a severe fear of heights should not attempt the final stretch but can enjoy the trail all the way to Scout Lookout. The best times to hike Angels Landing is in spring, summer and fall.  </p>
